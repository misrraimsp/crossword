Artificial Intelligence Lab: Constraint Satisfaction Problems.

There is a board of size: n x m fields to be used as a canvas for a crossword. A set S of all English words (or for any other natural language) can be used to select words from, but only k of them can be used in a crossword. The problem parameters are: S, n, m and k. We need to find such a way of placing words across the board that one field includes at most one letter and every continuous sequence of letters read horizontally or vertically is a word from the selected subset of the size k of S. A solution must include exactly k words from S. Some fields of the board can be left empty.

S is to be acquired in the following way (1) download the list of English lemmas extracted from the British National Corpus prepared by Prof. Adam Kilgarriff: https://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html (2) select from the list only: adverbs (adv), verbs (v), adjectives (a) and nouns (n)
